## Decoding the Tumor-ECM Dialogue

At the Izzi Lab, we seek to understand how tumors communicate with the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds them. This dynamic, bidirectional dialogue shapes cancer growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. By building and applying advanced computational models, we “listen in” on this interaction to uncover actionable vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.

Our research centers on three interconnected pillars:

### 1. Mapping the Tumor-ECM Ecosystem

To intervene effectively, we must first chart the landscape. We integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to build high-resolution models of the tumor microenvironment. Our goal is to uncover the principles governing how the matrisome—the full repertoire of ECM proteins—is assembled, remodeled, and hijacked during cancer progression.

**Matrisome Profiling:** Defining ECM signatures across cancers and subtypes.
**Cell–Matrix Communication:** Identifying the signaling pathways that mediate how cells sense, interpret, and modify their ECM.
**Spatial & Single-Cell Analysis:** Revealing how tumor–ECM interactions vary across space and between individual cells to drive heterogeneity.

### 2. Developing Next-Generation Computational & AI Tools

Conventional bioinformatics tools often overlook the ECM’s complexity. We therefore develop new computational frameworks tailored to matrix biology. By combining network science, statistical modeling, and machine learning, we build open-source tools that transform raw data into mechanistic insight.

**Predictive Modeling:** Leveraging AI and deep learning to forecast outcomes or treatment responses from ECM features.
**Algorithm Design:** Creating graph-based and systems-inspired algorithms to identify structural weak points in tumor–ECM networks.
**Flagship Software:** Building and maintaining accessible R packages such as MatrisomeAnalyzeR and MatriCom for the broader research community.

### 3. Translational Impact & Open Science

Our ultimate aim is to improve patient care. We work closely with clinicians and experimentalists to translate computational discoveries into clinically meaningful advances. By identifying network-based biomarkers and druggable ECM targets, we contribute to the development of next-generation cancer therapies.

**Therapeutic Targeting:** Highlighting ECM components and regulators essential for tumor survival.
**Biomarker Discovery:** Identifying matrisome signatures that predict metastasis, immune evasion, or therapy response.
**Open & Reproducible Science:** Committing to transparency by openly sharing our code, data, and analytic pipelines to accelerate progress across the field.
